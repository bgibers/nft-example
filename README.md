# NFT sample

Playing around with how to mint ERC721 (NFT). This project uses svg data stored completely on chain. The data itself is actually some adjectives I'd use to describe myself. Mint some NFTs to find out more about me

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
